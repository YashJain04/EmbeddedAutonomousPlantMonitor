# Embedded Autonomous Plant Monitor 🪴

An embedded autonomous plant monitor system I engineered that will automatically water plants based off environment variables such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and intensity of light.

## Tools Used 🛠️

To create this project I leveraged the Arduino Microcontroller Unit (MCU), along with other parts such as water pumps, moisture modules, humidity/temperature sensors.

This project was developed in C.

## Inspiration ✨

As a busy university computer science student, balancing academic commitments and maintaining healthy plants can be challenging. To ease this burden, I developed a tool that leverages technology to automate key tasks like watering and environmental monitoring, ensuring plants thrive with minimal time investment.

Let's cultivate a more sustainable world. 🍃
